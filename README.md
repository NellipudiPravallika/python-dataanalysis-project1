   5. graph2:<a href="https://github.com/NellipudiPravallika/python-dataanalysis-project1/blob/master/Figure_5.png">graph2</a>

4.GRAPHS ANALYSIS:

   1. first graph is plotted between "country" and "amount"
  
   2. second graph is plotted between "product" and "amount"
  
   3. in the first graph i plotted a line graph using pyplot from matplotlib library
  
   4. in the secong graph i plotted a bar graph using pyplot from matplotlib library
     
   5. i also applied legends using patches from matplotlib library
     
   6. i also applied titles to axis and also applied title to the graphs
